    "\n",
    "#### Recursion definition\n",
    "Recursion involves a function calling itself directly or indirectly. You probably have seen a recursive algorithm before, so we won't go into too much explanation here. As a toy example, consider the factorial function in math:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$n! = n\\cdot (n-1) \\cdot (n-2) \\cdot \\dots \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "(We define $0!=1$ and only allow factorials over the natural numbers for simplicity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how we can calculate $5!$. We know $5! = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$. Also, we know that $4!= 4 \\cdot 3\\cdot 2 \\cdot 1$. Factoring, we get $5! = 5 \\cdot 4!$, which shows that we can compute a factorial by computing smaller factorials first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we have the **recurrence** $n! = n \\cdot (n-1)!$. (If this isn't clear, try the factoring trick above with a few small values of $n$ to convince yourself this works.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that eventually, we have to calculate some factorial WITHOUT using the recurrence (otherwise, the recurrence would extend infinitely through the negative integers). Thus, we must have some **base case** (in this case, we define/know that $0!=1!=1$, so we use one of these base cases)."

    "#### How to implement recursion in your program\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithmic steps for implementing recursion in a function are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a **base case**: Identify the simplest case for which the solution is known or trivial. This is the stopping condition for the recursion, as it prevents the function from infinitely calling itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For the factorial function, this is the case $0!=1$ or $1!=1$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Define a **recurrence**: Define the problem in terms of smaller subproblems. Break the problem down into smaller versions of itself, and call the function recursively to solve each subproblem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For the factorial function, this is the recurrence $n!=n\\cdot(n-1)$.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ensure the recursion terminates: Make sure that the recursive function eventually reaches the base case, and does not enter an infinite loop. Recurrences that are infinite or self-referential are usually no good in computer science, unless they are used as either approximation algorithms or can be converted to finite-length recurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We can prove this for the factorial function using induction below.*\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combine the solutions: Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.\n",
