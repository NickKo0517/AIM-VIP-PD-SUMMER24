Hello and welcome to Purdue AIM! This is the repo containing the introductory assignment for Summer 2024 researchers and VIP students.

There are (eventually going to be) two types of modules in this assignment:
- Required modules (PD 1-5): These modules are required by all students and encompass critical skills for succeeding on this team.
- Selective modules (PD 6, 7): These modules are grouped into topics based on active research areas on this team. Most members should pick ONE selective to do and learn in-depth.
Combined with the 3 required VIP modules, that makes 10 PD activities for each VIP student in a semester.

Our current required topics list is:
- PD 1: Intro to lab servers, GitHub, etc. - how to access lab servers, how to use Git and GitHub, how to use Conda, how to navigate a terminal, etc.
- PD 2: Cool(er) stuff in Python - Python OOP, inheritance, polymorphism, concurrency, UnitTests, ABSL, and a bit of numpy/matplotlib
- PD 3: Building a MIDI Synth in Python - basic principles of sound synthesis, PrettyMIDI and basics of MIDI, collaboration, engineering/design process, intro to research
- PD 4: Research Communication - Reading research papers, Summarizing research papers, Presenting them to teammates
- PD 5: Logic, Proofs, Dynamic Programming, Recursion - basically baby CS 381

Our current selectives list is (two PDs each):
- Signal Processing: Audio in-depth, Convolution, DFT/FFT/STFT/all kinds of transforms, basic orthogonality proof and Fourier duality, spectrograms, modern topics in DSP, etc.
- Machine Learning: Build a machine learning model from scratch in PyTorch
- Robotics: ???

Note that these modules are much longer and harder than VIP PD traditionally is, even when you're spending the full required time on each PD activity. Plan to spend 2-4 hours per PD activity.

If you need help with this assignment, your first point of contact should be Microsoft Teams - there is a channel for questions called "VIP PD Questions". Leaders and other members will be answering questions there. You can also reach out to peers for help with the assignment - in fact, you are highly encouraged (and sometimes required) to do so!

This assignment may seem lengthy initially, but we want to ensure that everyone has a solid foundation for doing research this semester and beyond. Failure to properly attempt the assignments (or worse, cheating on them) will likely cause trouble down the road when you have to do these sorts of tasks independently. As such, even if it's not cheating, you should aim to complete the assignments without "relying" on others to drag you through. There is a fine line between using others' help efficiently and overusing it.
