    "## Part 1: Installing ROS & the Gazebo Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "ROS stands for Robot Operating System, and it is a set of libraries for robotics programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Linux as a VM on Windows or macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easist (as well as recommended) to use ROS with Linux systems. If you are on macOS, you are out of luck because there is no macOS support. If you are on Windows, you can *technically* use ROS, but it is still recommended to use Ubuntu. This is because some packages don't yet exist for Windows, and using the Linux version is also faster than using the Windows version. If you do not already use Linux, this means that you will need to set up an Ubuntu Linux VM (Virtual Machine). I personally use VirtualBox for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief summary of the steps needed to download Ubuntu on a VirtualBox VM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download [VirtualBox 7](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).\n",
    "2. Download an [Ubuntu 20.04 ISO](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04.6/?_gl=1*1t7f9g4*_gcl_au*MTk1NDQxMjYyMS4xNzA4NjY0Nzg5&_ga=2.215980757.35529440.1715893260-314673279.1715893260). It is important to use the 20.04 version, as the current LTS version is NOT compatible with ROS. \n",
    "3. Create a virtual machine by running VirtualBox and clicking the blue \"New\" button.\n",
    "    - Name this virtual machine \"Ubuntu\" or something similar.\n",
    "    - For the ISO image, select your downloaded Ubuntu image.\n",
    "    - The type should be Linux, and the version should be Ubuntu (64-bit).\n",
    "    - When creating your user profile on the next page titled \"Unattended Guest OS Install Setup\", make sure to change the username and password so you can have sudo access in the future.\n",
    "    - For resource specifications, use 8 GB RAM, 4 CPUs, and at least 25 GB Hard Disk size (provided your machine has at least 12 GB RAM, 6 threads, and 30 GB Hard Disk space available. If this isn't true, Teams DM for more help).\n",
    "4. Click start to launch your newly created virtual machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "More detailed installation instructions can be found on [this Ubuntu help page](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview). \n",
    "\n",
    "*(Ed's note: On Windows you may have a better time using Windows Subsystem for Linux which is more \"raw\" to the hardware, but I haven't experimented with this. Mac ARM users may benefit from using a more modern VM host that doesn't rely on Rosetta, such as VMWare Workstation Pro or Parallels. -Tim)*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing ROS\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Ubuntu, we can begin installation of our ROS software. We will download the Noetic Ninjemys version (Latest ROS 1 LTS). This can be done by simply opening the terminal in your VM and running the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qboticslabs/ros_install_noetic/master/ros_install_noetic.sh && chmod +x ./ros_install_noetic.sh && ./ros_install_noetic.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will install one additional tool called 'catkin-tools'. To do so, type the following line into the terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install python3-catkin-tools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will install a software called 'Turtlebot', which will be used as an example robot that we can move around within the Gazebo simulator. To install our Turtlebot, we will first use the following steps:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-noetic-hls-lfcd-lds-driver\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-noetic-dynamixel-sdk\n",
    "sudo apt install ros-noetic-turtlebot3-msgs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you are experiencing any errors with ROS + TurtleBot setup, try using the setup commands from [this link](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/#pc-setup). Then re-run the 3 instructions above for the Turtlebot installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will set up our source folder. Type the following into your terminal (line by line):\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src\n",
    "cd ~/catkin_ws/src/\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git\n",
    "cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As our example, we will be using the burger model of the TurtleBot3. Let's edit the bashrc file to add this model setting. \n",
    "```\n",
    "gedit ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can add the following line to the very bottom of our bashrc file: export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger \n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file and close out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's reload .bashrc with the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will download the TurtleBot3 simulation files:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd ~/catkin_ws/src/\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git\n",
    "cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have downloaded our ROS software and TurtleBot3, we can control our TurtleBot and move it around using the Gazebo simulator. To do so, simply type the following line into the terminal: \n",
    "```\n",
    "roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now successfully be able to see a Gazebo screen, where your TurtleBot should be visible. "

    "Next, type which model you chose for your TurtleBot **in the submission box**.\n",
    "\n",
